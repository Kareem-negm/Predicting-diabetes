# Predicting-diabetes
Diabetes is a serious, long-term condition with a major impact on the lives and well-being of individuals, families, and societies worldwide. It is among the top 10 causes of death in adults, and was estimated to have caused four million deaths globally in 2017 [1]. In 2017

he global diabetes prevalence in 2019 is estimated to be 9.3% (463 million people), rising to 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9% (700 million) by 2045. The prevalence is higher in urban (10.8%) than rural (7.2%) areas, and in high-income (10.4%) than low-income countries (4.0%). One in two (50.1%) people living with diabetes do not know that they have diabetes. The global prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance is estimated to be 7.5% (374 million) in 2019 and projected to reach 8.0% (454 million) by 2030 and 8.6% (548 million) by 2045
